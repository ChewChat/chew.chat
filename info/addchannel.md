To add your channel, you must either PM Chew or send a PR with the following info.

1) The Channel Name.

2) A channel description.

3) Any specific rules.

4) Channel Staff (and their roles)

A staff will join on official network business if they aren't already there. They will leave once they get the rest of the information needed.
